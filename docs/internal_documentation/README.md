I want all working-notes, implementation plans and other non official documents moved into this folder (most of them are in the internal-folder, but you need to do an evaluation).
The deal is that I want all .md's that are apparently either completed or discarded moved to /completed and anything recent and unfinished moved to todo. I also want to make sure the agent is aware of these folders and use them appropriately when a) starting something new, b) when completing something.

In yoiur cleanup, make sure to move good ideas that has not been implemented (and are fairly recent) are moved to /ideas.

Please also remake this README to explain the workflow in detail.
