## Project Overview

Implement comprehensive observability across all pyWATS components to improve production troubleshooting, monitoring, and diagnostics.

### Objective
Elevate observability from **6.5/10** to **8.5/10** by adding:
- Structured logging
- Metrics collection
- Health check endpoints
- Basic tracing capabilities

### Success Criteria
- ⏳ Standardized logging across all 19 components **[PENDING]**
- ✅ Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoints **[DONE - src/pywats/core/metrics.py]**
- ⏳ Health check endpoints for all services **[PENDING]**
- ⏳ Request/response logging with correlation IDs **[PENDING]**
- ✅ Error rate and latency metrics captured **[DONE - metrics module]**

### Sprint 1 Completed (100% ✅ MERGED to main):
- ✅ src/pywats/core/metrics.py (396 lines) - MERGED commit ddaf2dc
  - HTTP request tracking decorator (@track_request_metrics)
  - Error metrics tracking (track_error)
  - System resource metrics (CPU, memory, threads via psutil)
  - Queue depth and processing metrics (track_queue_metrics)
  - Converter execution metrics (track_converter_execution)
  - Metrics server with /metrics endpoint (start_metrics_server)
  - Background system monitoring thread
  - Thread-safe operations with prometheus_client
  - Graceful degradation if dependencies missing
- ✅ examples/observability/prometheus_monitoring.py (261 lines) - MERGED commit 1814d71
- ✅ prometheus-client dependency added to pyproject.toml
- ✅ psutil dependency added for system metrics

### Sprint 2 Remaining:
- ⏳ HTTP client instrumentation integration
- ⏳ Service integration
- ⏳ Correlation ID standardization
- ⏳ Health check enhancements
- ⏳ Tests and documentation

### Impact
**High** - Critical for production operations, troubleshooting, and meeting enterprise observability requirements.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Structured logging framework (JSON logs)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus format)
- Health check endpoints (/health, /ready)
- Request correlation IDs
- Performance metrics (latency, throughput)
- Error tracking and reporting

### Out of Scope (Future Work)
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Log aggregation infrastructure (ELK/Splunk)
- Alerting rules and dashboards
- APM integration (DataDog/New Relic)

## Related Health Checks
- All components: Observability category currently 6.5/10 average
- Targets: Bring all components to 8+/10
