I want to try to track the work done on this project since it was created.

I want to create some timelines for:
1: Version progress.
2: Feature progress.
3: Codebase growth.
4: Total tokens used.
5: Hours spent prompting ort prompt-count.
6: Hours of development time done (based on your estimates in manual programming time)
7: Real hours spent by the agent to complete these tasks (I want the diff from 6)
8: Number of analysis steps done - or a pattern on how the split is between analysis, planning, implementation and testing.
9: How much refactoring is done.

I knwo this is a lot to ask, and that you probably dont have any easily accessable data on many of these, but your best try will be good enough. This report will be used to argue that extensive use of AI in our development team is advised and a cost saver. I also want to use the data to furter evaluate my workflows.
