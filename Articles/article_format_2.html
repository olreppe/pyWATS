  <p>
    Quick intro for new users to essential WATS reports and views for analyzing
    test and repair data.
  </p>
</zd-summary-block>
<p>
  WATS gathers all your test and repair data in real time, allowing you to 1. easily
  <strong>find and explore</strong> that data, and 2. perform
  <strong>root cause analysis.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  To get started, here are a few examples of reports and views in WATS, what they
  are, why use them and an example of how.&nbsp;

  <strong>Dynamic yield</strong>
</h3>
<p>What:</p>
<p>
  Allows you to create virtually any yield-chart, by selecting the columns for
  aggregation.
</p>
<p>Why:</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-item-id="e8dc59639048d0367885d4965deff7510">
    Get an overview of test-results aggregated and grouped based on your needs
  </li>
  <li data-list-item-id="e04b6d143ccc8356069f78899fc1630a4">Identify deviations to assist in root cause analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>
  In this example we see #units tested, #test reports, #retests, and yield statistics,
  split by stations used for a specific Part number and Test operation. In doing
  so, we've identified stations with poor yield

  <strong>Process Heatmap</strong>
</h3>
<p>What:</p>
<p>
  The heatmaps offer an overview of manufacturing processes associated with a chosen
  category (e.g., Part number), with each row representing a distinct production
  line.
</p>
<p>
  Presented in a cross-table format, each cell offers key insights and various
  drilldown options for further analysis.
</p>
<p>Why:</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-item-id="e3ec5a2e3c6c23972ff9e0e8598e2be46">
    Gives a high-level overview of all production lines, with key insights
  </li>
  <li data-list-item-id="ee83559e1dd070004f248ede9473395a5">
    Helps identify and prioritize areas of interest and potential yield improvements
  </li>
  <li data-list-item-id="eff261689513b4211dc6e70cf6b9b8fba">Recommended starting point for most analysis purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>
  Shows a set of part numbers and processes (test operations) they go through.
  Along with key insights for each part number/process combination: #Units tested
  and retested, yield statistics, stations, repairs and top 10 issues. Furthermore,
  on the right, WATS Alvea is providing suggestions for where to focus our attention,
  based on potential yield gains.

  <strong>Unit Flow</strong>
</h3>
<p>What:</p>
<p>
  Provides comprehensive visibility into the flow of units across the production
  line. It offers an adaptable overview, allowing users to visualize and analyze
  production data from various perspectives.
</p>
<p>
  The flow is mapped based on test and repair reports, generating a main process
  flow while highlighting units that deviate from the standard path. This includes
  units that bypass certain steps, follow an unusual order, or skip processes altogether.
</p>
<p>Why:</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-item-id="e02f943fcf9936a9b3fa859dc0f9d397c">
    Ensure products follow valid process flows to identify deviations and root
    causes, both high-level and for specific serial numbers
  </li>
  <li data-list-item-id="eedf423e9391823ed891330b95bd73397">
    Detect bottlenecks and inefficiencies to optimize process performance
  </li>
  <li data-list-item-id="ed1c0bffeb19d201e67b5c9c141f73af1">
    Reduce operational costs by proactively preventing disruptions
  </li>
  <li data-list-item-id="eec899ba9801b77e38ac4d0cf22dfdc2f">
    Compare performance across factories, products, or production lines
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>
  Shows #units going through the main flow of Insulation test, Pre Burn-in Test,
  Burn-in Test and Final Function Test. Also, shows deviations from this flow,
  including units that are retested, skipping entire processes, returning to a
  previous process and going out for repair.

  <strong>Test Reports</strong>
</h3>
<p>What:</p>
<p>
  Test report lookup intended for finding and analyzing a specific set of test
  reports. Provides a list of up to the last 1000 UUT reports matching your filtering.
  For the given data set, a Step caused UUT fail chart, Passed in run chart, as
  well as multiple pie charts are provided.
</p>
<p>Why:</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-item-id="ed0388a7d4e945e0543faeb5690dda853">Find specific UUT reports</li>
  <li data-list-item-id="ef58d496e2cca1298a5389eee9e5ef568">Analyze smaller data sets</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note: When dealing with large datasets in WATS, we recommend using for example
  the Test Step Analysis (TSA) module..
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>
  User searched for a specific batch number to find their UUT reports.

  <strong>Test Step Analysis</strong>
</h3>
<p>What:</p>
<p>
  Provides tools to analyze specific test steps of one or more sequences. It enables
  a visual representation of the actual measurements, as well as analysis for top
  failing, most time-consuming steps, cpk metrics and more.
</p>
<p>Why:</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-item-id="efdd45837e77403567e5a33386dcc02ca">
    High level overview of a test sequence, along with yields and other metrics
    for each test step.
  </li>
  <li data-list-item-id="e05b8b0b291c18fc1c8a67530fb389508">
    Identify test steps causing issues, e.g. steps causing failures, wide cpk's,
    long step times etc.
  </li>
  <li data-list-item-id="e62d5610f72e94336cd619fdbaa3534c4">Perform root cause analysis to improve test sequence</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>
  Sorting the test steps by various column options to identify steps that require
  adjustments to limits, or frequently failing steps for root cause analysis.

  <strong>Step Details</strong>
</h3>
<p>What:</p>
<p>
  Enables detailed exploration of step measurements. It offers multiple views for
  high level and detailed analysis of one or more test step, to help identify trends,
  correlations and deviations. Can be accessed directly via the Process Heatmap
  using Top 10 Issues, or by selecting one or more steps in Test Step Analysis.&nbsp;
