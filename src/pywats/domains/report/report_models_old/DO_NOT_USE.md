# ⚠️ ARCHIVED - DO NOT USE ⚠️

**This directory contains the V1 report model implementation.**

## Status: ARCHIVED

This code is kept for reference only while verifying the V3 migration. 

**DO NOT:**
- Import from this module
- Make changes to these files
- Use this as a template for new code

**INSTEAD USE:**
- `pywats.domains.report.report_models` (V3 implementation - current)

## Why Keep This?

During the V3 migration verification process, we may need to reference the V1 
implementation to understand original behavior or debug edge cases. Once the 
migration is fully verified and stable, this directory should be deleted.

## Migration Status

- [x] V3 report models are the default at `report_models/`
- [x] All 135 report tests pass with V3
- [x] V1 archived here for reference

---
*This directory will be deleted after migration verification is complete.*
