Make a thorogh analysis on how we best can separate the GUI from the client.
Take into account that what we currently call GUI is in reality the pyWATS Client Configurator. Other small apps will be implemented, either as stand alone or as part of the Client Configurator. We shlud probably think of a better naming and organization than "gui". Also consider how we can reuse gui-frameworks across different apps sop we dont have to start from scratch for each new one.

What I want to know is:
- Best options for design and implementation
- Gains vs Added complexity and maintenance

Once we agree we will make the choice into a implementation plan and a project.
