## Project Overview

MQTT-based IoT integration for edge devices, sensors, and lightweight test equipment

## Source Materials

This analysis consolidates information from the following idea documents:

- MQTT_IOT_INTEGRATION.md

## Summary

This project has been promoted from the ideas folder. The source documents contain detailed analysis and background information that should be reviewed before proceeding with implementation planning.

See the source documents in this folder for comprehensive details.

## Key Insights

Review the source documents for:
- Technical requirements and constraints
- Architecture considerations
- Integration points and dependencies
- Implementation complexity estimates
- Strategic value and prioritization factors

## Next Steps

1. Review all source documents thoroughly
2. Update the implementation plan (02_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
3. Define initial tasks in TODO (04_TODO.md)
4. Move to active when ready to begin implementation
