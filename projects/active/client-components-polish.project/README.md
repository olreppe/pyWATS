## Project Overview

Polish and complete client components and examples to improve developer experience and reduce onboarding friction.

### Objective
Elevate client components from **54-72/80** to **75+/80** by:
- Completing missing example code
- Standardizing error handling
- Improving documentation
- Adding usage guides

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All client examples have complete, runnable code
- ✅ Error handling follows consistent patterns
- ✅ Documentation includes common use cases
- ✅ Getting started guide under 15 minutes
- ✅ Client examples score 70+/80 in health checks

### Impact
**Medium** - Improves developer experience and reduces onboarding time, but core functionality is already complete and working.
