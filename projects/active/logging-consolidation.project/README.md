# Logging Infrastructure Consolidation

**Status:** 🚧 In Progress (Phase 1 Complete ✅, Phase 2 Starting)  
**Progress:** 15% (Phase 1/6 done)  
**Priority:** P1  
**Timeline:** 2 weeks (Started: Feb 3, 2026 | Phase 1 Complete: Feb 3, 2026)  
**Created:** February 3, 2026

## 📋 Objective

Consolidate and standardize logging infrastructure across the entire pyWATS ecosystem (API, Client, GUI, Converters) with proper separation of concerns, reusability, and comprehensive logging capabilities.

**Key Goals:**
- Consolidate dispersed logging implementations
- Eliminate duplication and inconsistencies
- Implement top-level `pywats.log` for client (installation directory)
- Add per-conversion `ConversionLog` for detailed converter logging
- Enable exception bubbling from converters → client → GUI
- Prepare for GUI separation (maintain clean boundaries)
- Reusable logging framework across all components

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ **Analysis Complete:**
- [x] All logging locations mapped across codebase ✅
- [x] Duplication and inconsistencies documented ✅
- [x] Current state assessment complete ✅
- [x] Best practices and patterns identified ✅

🚧 **Unified Framework (Phase 1 COMPLETE):**
- [x] Single source of truth for logging configuration ✅ (configure_logging)
- [x] Structured logging (JSON) support across all components ✅ (format="json")
- [x] Correlation ID tracking end-to-end ✅ (enable_correlation_ids)
- [x] Context-aware logging utilities ✅ (LoggingContext)
- [x] File rotation support ✅ (FileRotatingHandler)
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage ✅ (26 tests)

⏳ **Client Logging (Phase 2 - Starting):**
- [ ] Top-level `pywats.log` in installation directory
- [ ] Rotating file handlers (size + time-based)
- [ ] Configurable log levels per component
- [ ] Performance impact < 5% overhead

⏳ **Converter Logging (Phase 3):**
- [ ] `ConversionLog` per conversion in `ConverterBase`
- [ ] Detailed conversion step tracking
- [ ] Error context preservation
- [ ] Log files in converter-specific directory

✅ **Exception Handling:**
- [ ] Exceptions bubble from converter → client → GUI
- [ ] Full stack traces preserved in logs
- [ ] User-friendly error messages in GUI
- [ ] Debug information available for troubleshooting

✅ **Testing & Documentation:**
- [ ] Logging tests for all components
- [ ] Migration guide for existing code
- [ ] Developer guide for logging best practices
- [ ] Examples for common logging scenarios

## 📊 Metrics

- **Current State:** 
  - Logging locations: 50+ files
  - Duplicate implementations: ~5 patterns
  - Inconsistent configuration: Yes
  - Structured logging: Partial (API only)

- **Target State:**
  - Unified framework: 1 core module
  - Consistent patterns: 100%
  - Structured logging: All components
  - Performance overhead: < 5%

## 📝 Key Requirements Summary

### 1. Top-Level Client Log (`pywats.log`)
- Location: Client installation directory
- Persistent across restarts
- Rotating (size + time-based)
- All client activity logged

### 2. Per-Conversion Logs
- Created by `ConverterBase`
- One `ConversionLog` per conversion
- Detailed step-by-step tracking
- Stored in converter-specific directory

### 3. Exception Bubbling
- Converter exceptions → Client service
- Client exceptions → GUI (if attached)
- Full context preserved
- Stack traces in debug logs

### 4. Component Boundaries
- API: `pywats.core.logging` (existing, enhance)
- Client: `pywats_client.core.logging` (new)
- GUI: Uses client logging (clean interface)
- Converters: Integrated into `ConverterBase`

### 5. GUI Separation Ready
- No direct dependencies on GUI from logging
- Clean interfaces for error reporting
- Async-safe logging throughout
- Testable without GUI

---

## ⚠️ Constraints

- **No Breaking Changes:** Existing logging calls must continue to work
- **Performance:** Logging overhead < 5% in production
- **Backward Compatibility:** Deprecate old patterns gracefully
- **Thread Safety:** Safe in async and multi-threaded contexts
