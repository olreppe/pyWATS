## Project Overview

Optimize pyWATS performance through caching strategies, async/await patterns, and systematic benchmarking to prepare for scale.

### Objective
Elevate performance from **6.8/10** to **8.5/10** by implementing:
- Caching strategies (TTL, LRU)
- Async/await patterns where beneficial
- Performance benchmarking framework
- Query optimization

### Success Criteria
- ⏳ 50%+ reduction in repeated query response times (via caching) **[CACHE MODULE EXISTS, NEEDS INTEGRATION]**
- ⏳ Async implementations for I/O-bound operations **[PENDING]**
- ⏳ Performance benchmarks established for all critical paths **[PENDING]**
- ⏳ Query optimization reducing database calls by 30%+ **[PENDING]**
- ⏳ Load testing framework in place **[PENDING]**

### Cache Foundation Complete (100%):
- ✅ src/pywats/core/cache.py (635 lines) - Pre-existing, validated in this sprint
  - TTL-based cache with automatic expiration
  - LRU eviction when max size reached  
  - Thread-safe operations with RLock (full reentrancy support)
  - Async cache variant (AsyncTTLCache) for async/await patterns
  - Cache statistics tracking (hits, misses, evictions, hit rate)
  - Decorator support (@cached, @async_cached)
  - CacheEntry and CacheStats dataclasses
  - Comprehensive sharding documentation for high concurrency
- ✅ aiohttp dependency added for async HTTP operations
- ✅ Cache module tested and ready for integration

### Integration Remaining:
- ⏳ HTTP client cache integration
- ⏳ Domain service caching
- ⏳ Async HTTP client implementation
- ⏳ Async domain services
- ⏳ Benchmarking framework
- ⏳ Query optimization analysis

### Impact
**Medium** - Improves user experience and prepares system for scale. Not critical for current usage but important for growth.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Caching layer implementation (Redis/memory)
- Async/await pattern adoption
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Query optimization analysis
- Load testing framework
- Response time profiling

### Out of Scope (Future Work)
- Horizontal scaling architecture
- Database sharding
- CDN integration
- Advanced query optimization (database tuning)

## Related Health Checks
- All components: Performance category currently 6.8/10 average
- Key targets:
  - Report domain (complex queries)
  - API Queue (throughput)
  - Client converters (processing speed)
