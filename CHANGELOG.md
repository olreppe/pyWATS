## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0b6] - 2025-12-18

### Added

- **Request Throttling** - Built-in rate limiting to comply with WATS API limits (500 requests/minute)
  - New `RateLimiter` class with sliding window algorithm
  - Thread-safe implementation for concurrent usage
  - Configurable via `configure_throttling()` function
  - Can be disabled for testing with `configure_throttling(enabled=False)`
  - Statistics tracking (total requests, wait time, throttle count)

- **Analytics Typed Models** - New Pydantic models for analytics responses
  - `TopFailedStep` - Failed step statistics
  - `RepairStatistics` - Repair loop metrics
  - `RepairHistoryRecord` - Individual repair records
  - `MeasurementData` - Measurement values with statistics
  - `AggregatedMeasurement` - Time-series measurement aggregations
  - `OeeAnalysisResult` - OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) analysis

- **Analytics Documentation** - Added docstrings with examples to all 23 analytics service methods

### Fixed

- **RootCause Acceptance Tests** - Fixed `DummyRootCauseRepository` to properly inherit from `RootCauseRepository`

## [0.1.0b5] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- **CI/CD** - Added `contents: read` permission to publish workflow for private repo checkout.

## [0.1.0b4] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- **Release pipeline** - Fixed flake8 `F821` (missing `Path` import) blocking the PyPI publish workflow.

## [0.1.0b3] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- **Cross-platform packaging** - Corrected package directory casing to `src/pywats` to avoid Linux/macOS import/install issues.
- **Release hygiene** - Ensured `tests/`, `docs/`, and other dev-only folders are excluded from PyPI artifacts and added publish-time guards.
- **UUT report parsing robustness** - Added a safe fallback for unknown step types and improved tolerance for null numeric values.
- **Query filtering** - Normalized `status=all` to omit the status filter (treat as “no status filter”).

## [0.1.0b2] - 2025-12-15

### Changed

- **Architecture Refactoring** - Internal API separation
  - All internal endpoint implementations now in separate `_internal` files
  - New `AssetRepositoryInternal` and `AssetServiceInternal` for file operations
  - New `ProductionRepositoryInternal` and `ProductionServiceInternal` for MES operations
  - Public repositories delegate to internal repositories for internal endpoints
  - Added `api.asset_internal` for asset file operations (upload, download, list, delete)
  - Added `api.production_internal` for MES unit phases

### Fixed

- CompOp export path handling for None values
- TestInstanceConfig field mapping for process_code/test_operation

## [0.1.0b1] - 2025-12-14

### Added

- **PyWATS API Library** (`pywats`)
  - Product management (get, create, update products and revisions)
  - Asset management (equipment tracking, calibration, maintenance)
  - Report submission and querying (UUT/UUR reports in WSJF format)
  - Production/serial number management (units, batches, assemblies)
  - RootCause ticket system (issue tracking and resolution)
  - Software distribution (package management, releases)
  - Statistics and analytics endpoints
  - Station concept for multi-station deployments

- **PyWATS Client Application** (`pywats_client`)
  - Desktop GUI mode (PySide6/Qt)
  - Headless mode for servers and embedded systems (Raspberry Pi)
  - Connection management with encrypted token storage
  - Converter framework for custom file format processing
  - Report queue with offline support
  - HTTP control API for remote management

- **Developer Features**
  - Comprehensive type hints throughout
  - Pydantic models for data validation
  - Structured logging with debug mode
  - Async-ready architecture

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
