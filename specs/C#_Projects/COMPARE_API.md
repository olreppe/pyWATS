Can you please do a thorough analysis of my pyWATS/modules and compare them with the existing functionallity of the original C# code in specs/c#_projects/. The layer TDM/MES is non existing in this project deliberatly. I  want you to make an organized overview of what functionallity exists in the C# version that is missing in the pyton modules. The functions in the TDM module will be in the root of pyWATS, except report-related ones that goes in pyWATS.report. I want to use your analysis to instruct my LLM on the implementation.
